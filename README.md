# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard: Attrition and Employee Performance Analysis

## ✨ Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize key Human Resources metrics, with a primary focus on understanding and mitigating **Employee Attrition**.

The dashboard provides HR managers and business stakeholders with actionable insights into employee demographics, performance, job satisfaction, and the factors driving employees to leave the organization.

## 📈 Key Metrics & Insights

The dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions, focusing on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and analytical views:

### Key Metrics:

* **Attrition Rate:** The central metric, tracking the percentage of employees who have left the company.
* **Average Tenure:** The average number of years employees stay with the company.
* **Employee Count and Gender Split:** Total workforce size and demographic distribution.

### Core Insights:

* **Attrition by Salary:** Analysis of the attrition rate across different salary slabs, identifying potential compensation issues (e.g., highest attrition often concentrated in lower pay bands).
* **Attrition by Years at Company:** Visualizing employee turnover based on their tenure, often highlighting high-risk periods (e.g., 1-3 years of service).
* **Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition:** Correlation between employee satisfaction scores and the decision to leave.
* **Department and Job Role Analysis:** Drill-down views to pinpoint which departments or specific job roles are experiencing the highest turnover.
